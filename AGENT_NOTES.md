# Agent Core Conventions

Minimal set of rules to persist across sessions. Keep this file short.

## Commit Messages
* Conventional Commits: `type(scope): subject`
* Subject line: <= 72 chars, imperative ("add", "fix", "refactor")
* No redundant history commentary (only what this commit changes)

## Interactive Git Operations
Before running something that opens an editor (rebase -i, amend, etc.):
1. State goal
2. Show command (do **not** run yet)
3. Describe expected buffer & required edits
4. Provide save / abort instructions (`:wq` / `:q!`)
5. Wait for explicit "proceed"

## Data Sensitivity
* Treat `test*.json` as confidential; only derive structure if needed

## Assistant Behavior
* After each commit: immediately `git push origin <current-branch>` (auto-push)
* To temporarily disable auto-push (e.g. for squashing / amend / rebase): user says "pause auto-push"; resume with "resume auto-push"
* Never auto-push while an interactive rewrite (rebase -i, amend-in-progress) is pending
* Enforce 72â€‘char subject rule
* Keep diffs minimal & relevant
* After code changes: ensure `go build ./...` passes
* Always use `make build` to produce the runnable binary (ensures output in `bin/client`)
* Avoid running plain `go build ./cmd/client` directly (may leave an unused `./client` binary)
